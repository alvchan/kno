# Kno

A freeform system to store and identify what I know in a concise and informative
format. Supposedly a way to store and access via `vim` and `less` with goals of
working like `man` or something closer to Obsidian for more intuitive, efficient
usage.

## Origin

Created out of a need for a dumber variant of Obsidian and its link system.
Originally was made using plaintext and Vim link jumps with `gf`/`C-o` and
`less` to read like `man`.

Named `kno` as search for the word 'know', but as a three letter word/name like
`vim`/`man`/`GNU`. Meant to be pronounced as 'kuh-noo', which is obviously
inspired by/mocking the pronounciation of GNU (guh-noo).
