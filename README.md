# Kno

A freeform system to store and identify what I know in a concise and informative
format. Supposedly a way to store and access via `vim` and `less` with goals of
working like `man` or something closer to Obsidian for more intuitive, efficient
usage.

## Origin

Created out of a need for a dumber variant of Obsidian and its link system.
Originally was made using plaintext and Vim link jumps with `gf`/`C-o` and
`less` to read like `man`.

Named `kno` as short for the word 'know', but as a three letter word/name like
`vim`/`man`/`GNU`. Meant to be pronounced as 'kuh-noo', which is obviously
inspired by/mocking the pronunciation of GNU (guh-nu).

## Philosophy

Kno is more than just a way for me to store information, it is also meant as
a way to distribute said info via GitHub to others. I permit anyone to use it as
they'd like and only request that they give feedback where appropriate. Notes
will be released on a rolling basis, i.e. as I complete and polish them.
