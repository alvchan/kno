# Patch Panel [cta-patchp.md]

An intermediary device to permanently connect many systems to one networking
setup. On the other side, has RJ45 interfaces to be connected with the actual
switches of the network. Primarily used to group cables to one place, simplify
setup and redirection, and extend connections. 

Redirection in a patch panel setup is as simple as changing the connection on
the patch panel to a different switch within the wiring closet. This abstracted,
interface-like ability to change and redirect also reduces potential errors in
the setup.
